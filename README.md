# Low Vision Simulation Web App

This project is a web-based application designed to simulate various low vision effects on images and 360 videos. It allows users to apply multiple image effects such as light degradation, color shift, spatial distortion, and more to understand how different visual impairments affect perception.

## Usage

- **Import Image:** Upload an image to apply various visual effects.
- **Import 360 Video:** Upload an image to apply various visual effects.
- **Apply Effects:** Apply different perceptual low vision effects.
- **Reorder Effects:** Effects can be reordered to change the order in which they're applied.
- **Export Configurations:** Save the current effect settings as a JSON file.
- **Import Configurations:** Load previously saved configurations to restore the effect settings.
- **Adjust Parameters:** Each effect can be customized using certain parameters.

## Effects Included

The following visual effects can be applied to the image:

1. **Light Degradation**
2. **Rotation Distortion**
3. **Spatial Distortion**
4. **Infilling**
5. **Visual Acuity Loss**
6. **Color Shift**
7. **Field of View Reduction**
8. **Contrast Change**

## Requirements

- **Modern Web Browser**

## Installation

To run the project locally, launch the server in the root directory,
